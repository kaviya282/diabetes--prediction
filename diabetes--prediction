A system is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on some of its health-related details such as BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, Insulin, etc. This system is only for females as the dataset used to make this system exclusively belongs to the females.The accuracy level was 90% using the random forest algorithm, which is much higher when compared to other algorithms. In a recent paper [5], Mohan and Jain used the SVM algorithm to analyze and predict diabetes with the help of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset.
